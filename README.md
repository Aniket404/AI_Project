Human emotion classification utilizes one hot encoding for data preprocessing, converting categorical labels into a binary matrix. Emotion classification is performed using an LSTM neural network, known for its effectiveness in capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, enhancing the model's ability to discern nuanced patterns in dynamic emotional expressions.
